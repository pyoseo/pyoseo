PyOSEO - a Python OGC OSEO server
---------------------------------

This project aims to create a server implementing OGC Ordering Service for
Earth Observation Products (OGC 06-141)

The ordering server is implemented as a Django application. As such, it can be
incorporated into existing Django projects.

It is still in heavy development.
